<h1>Dynamic Accessible Graphs Demonstration</h1>

<p>This is a demonstration of integrating accessibility into graphs on a website.
It is intended to show the concept, and many updates will have to be made to make
the idea ready for production.</p>

<p>Data is being dynamically loaded from a CSV file. The audio and text descriptions 
do not change, but could be implemented now with a hook-in with the accessible
graphing engine.</p>
